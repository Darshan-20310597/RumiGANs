Teaching A GAN What Not to Learn
====================

### Introduction

This is the Code submission accompanying the NeurIPS 2020 paper, titled "Teaching a GAN What Not to Learn."

This code contained the implementations of baseline SGAN, LSGAN, ACGAN, TACGAN, and CGAN-PD employed in the paper to generate the desired results. All code in written in TensorFlow2.x  In its current state, the code can be used to train new models. Pre-trained models of will be made available shortly.
